With an overview of the interface, you are now ready to build a dashboard by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the Superstore Sales sheet. You should see a blank dashboard.

2. Successively double-click each of the following sheets listed in the Dashboard section on the left: Sales by Department, Sales over time, and Sales by Postal Code. Notice that double-clicking the object adds it to the layout of the dashboard.

3. Add a title to the dashboard by checking Show Dashboard title in the lower left of the sidebar.

4. Select the Sales by Department sheet in the dashboard and click the drop-down arrow to show the menu.

5. Select Fit | Entire View. The Fit options describe how the visualization should fill any available space.

Be careful when using various Fit options. If you are using a dashboard with a size that has not been fixed or if your view dynamically changes the number of items displayed based on interactivity, then what might have once looked good might not fit the view nearly as well.

6. Select the Sales size legend by clicking it. Use the Remove UI element to remove the legend from the dashboard.

7. Select the Profit color legend by clicking it. Use the grip to drag the legend, and place it under the map.
